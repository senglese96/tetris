* Background and Overview  
    I have always believed tetris to be the perfect game. It's easy to pick up and play, and hard to master.
    it's been shown to be theraputic for insomniacs and PTSD patients, and almost everyone understands the basic concept of it.  
    Blocks fall at a certain speed until they reach the bottom of a  grid. If a complete line of blocks is formed,  
    it will disappear and the rest of the stack will move down and the players score will increase. blocks fall faster
    and faster until the stack overlaps with the place where the blocks spawn.
* MVP's
    * Is fully interactive with buttons to cause the blocks to rotate, instant drop, fast drop and hold a piece
    * Game functions properly, clearing blocks when they are meant to be cleared.
    * Game interface allows changing/turning off music, and piece variety
    * Will display a game over screen when a top out occurs
